# Jarvis-Entreprise

## Runtime

JARVIS Enterprise keeps external runtimes isolated from the main Python environment.

### Hermes Agent

Hermes is integrated as the operational agent runtime through `jarvis.runtime.HermesAdapter`.
Its source checkout and dependencies stay isolated under `.runtime/hermes-agent/` and are not vendored into the JARVIS package.

Setup in a Codespace:

```bash
git pull
bash scripts/setup_hermes.sh
```

The setup script clones the official Hermes repository, runs its supported `uv sync` environment setup, and verifies that `AIAgent` can be imported. Hermes currently requires Python `>=3.11,<3.14`; this is intentionally kept separate from JARVIS's main environment.

After setup, API/provider credentials must be configured according to Hermes' own configuration rules before executing model-backed tasks. Secrets must not be committed to Git.
